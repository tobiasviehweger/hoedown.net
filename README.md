Hoedown.net
===========

Hoedown.net provides .NET bindings for the nice and popular
[hoedown markdown library](https://github.com/hoedown/hoedown).

It was forked from Sundown.net, which supplies bindings to sundown, the hoedown predecessor.

The aim of this library is to provide all the functionality
that hoedown provides alongside the possibility to do stuff
quickly (simple API).

It is ridicolously fast compared to pure .NET/Regex implementations.

Compiling Hoedown with Visual Studio 2013
